StarryPy Command Dispatcher Plugin

A plugin which handles user commands. All plugins wishing to provide commands
should register themselves through CommandDispatcher.

This should be done by using the @Command decorator in a SimpleCommandPlugin
subclass, though it could be done manually in tricky use-cases.
